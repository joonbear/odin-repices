    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Geotjeori is a freshly made salad with a crisp texture and refreshing flavour. It can be made with any vegetables you have. Popular green leaves in Korea include lettuce, cabbage, chicory greens and kale. This salad is particularly tasty when served with the tofu-jang shown on the previous page. The braised tofu can be eaten by itself or with bread.</p>
